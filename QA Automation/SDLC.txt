Software Engineering
    - Software Engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software using techniques like requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance.
    - It ensures software is high-quality, reliable, and maintainable, especially for large software systems.

Key Principles :-
    - Modularity: Divide software into small, independent parts that are easy to develop and test.
    - Abstraction: Show only what is necessary and hide internal implementation details.
    - Encapsulation: Keep data and related functions together and protect them from outside access.
    - Reusability: Build components that can be reused in different projects to save time and effort.
    - Maintenance: Regularly update software to fix bugs, improve features, and enhance security.
    - Testing: Check the software to ensure it works correctly and meets requirements.
    - Design Patterns: Use proven solutions for common software design problems.
    - Agile Methodologies: Develop software in small steps with frequent feedback and flexibility.
    - Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD): Frequently merge code changes and automatically deploy updates.

Objectives
    - Maintainability: It should be feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.
    - Efficiency: The software should not make wasteful use of computing devices such as memory, processor cycles, etc.
    - Correctness: A software product is correct if the different requirements specified in the SRS Document have been correctly implemented.
    - Reusability: A software product has good reusability if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.
    - Testability: Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software concerning those criteria.
    - Reliability: It is an attribute of software quality. The extent to which a program can be expected to perform its desired function, over an arbitrary time period.
    - Portability: In this case, the software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.
    - Adaptability: In this case, the software allows differing system constraints and the user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software.
    - Interoperability: Capability of 2 or more functional units to process data cooperatively.

NOTE :- The main responsibility of a software engineer is to develop useful computer programs and applications. Working in teams, you would complete various projects and develop solutions to satisfy certain customer or corporate demands.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) :-
    - The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured framework used by software organizations to design, develop, and test high-quality software.
    - Without a structured SDLC, software development becomes chaotic. Teams may miss requirements, blow budgets, or deliver buggy code that doesn't solve the user's problem.

Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle :-
    - Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
        - This is the most fundamental stage. Before writing code, the team must define what they are building and why.
        - Planning -> Define Project Scope -> Set Objectives and goals -> Resource Planning.
        - Key Players: Senior Engineers, Project Managers, Stakeholders.
    
    Stage 2: Defining Requirements (SRS)
        - Once the plan is approved, the specific product requirements must be defined and documented. This is done through the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
        - Defining -> Functional Requirement -> Technical Requirement -> Requirements review & approved.
        - Activities: Gathering detailed functional and non-functional requirements from customers.
        - Output: SRS Document (The "Bible" for the development team).
        - Key Players: Business Analysts (BAs), Product Owners.

    Stage 3: Designing Architecture
        - The requirements are turned into a technical blueprint. This phase defines the overall system architecture and technology stack.
        - High-Level Design (HLD): Defines the architecture, database design, and relationships between modules.
        - Low-Level Design (LLD): Defines the logic of individual components, API interfaces, and database tables.
        - Output: Design Document Specification (DDS).
        - Key Players: System Architects, Lead Developers.

    Stage 4: Development (Coding)
        - This is the longest phase where the actual building takes place. Developers write code based on the Design Document.
        - Activities: Coding, Code Reviews, Unit Testing, and Static Code Analysis.
        - Tools: Compilers, Debuggers, IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ), Version Control (Git).
        - Output: Source Code, Executable Software.
        - Key Players: Developers (Frontend, Backend, Full Stack).
