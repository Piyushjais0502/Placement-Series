An SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) is not :
    - Just someone who executes test cases
    - Just someone who automation scripts
    - Just someone who clicks button faster using tools.

An SDET  is an engineer who is responsible for quality.
    = Understand how applications are built.
    - Write code to test systems.
    = Test APIs even before UI is ready.
    - Help developers find issues early.
    - Build automation framework teams rely on.
    - Ensure releases are stable and reliable.

    - SDET is an hybrid role. (testing and developing).
    - Thinks like a tester
    - Code like a developer.
    - Works like an engineer.
